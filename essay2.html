    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
      Tsarist Russia shattered after the Bolshevik revolution in 1917. Then, the newly 
established union of the Soviet Socialist Republic (USSR) bestowed a difficult era not 
only to Muslims, but also to the whole people. The Bolshevik establishment under the 
authority of Lenin was adding up Muslims who obeyed for pills in Tsarist Russia. But, 
after gaining authority, they accepted a completely different stance. In the first 
decade, the USSR engaged defenses and reforms to ruin government languages, 
religion, heritage and culture. They oppressed vivid editions of Cyrillic alphabets on 
Turkey-Muslim communities to ruin the linguistic unity.   
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">After the death of Lenin in 1922, Stalin came to power and proved that he is more 
aggressive than his ancestor. The communist government under Stalin, led war over 
all religions in the periods of 1924-1926 including Christianity. He found that the Islam 
of most Turkish communities is the biggest threat to the Soviet Union. He believed 
that their communism wouldn’t win without wiping out of Islam. So, he implemented a 
special policy against Muslims. During 1926 – 1927, religious schools were closed 
and mosques demolished and rendered useless. Only the elderly were allowed to use 
the small mosques that remained. Stalin, one of the most brutal dictators in history, 
ordered the demolition of thirty thousand mosques and ordered some mosques to be 
used as barns. He ordered the collecting and burning of Qurans. During his reign, 
hundreds of Muslim scholars were killed and thousands of people were exiled to the 
freezing wastelands of Siberia where they faced death. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">  They burned hundreds of Islamic holy books containing libraries in major centers 
of learning in Islam like Samarkand, Bukhara, Derbant, Kokand, Kashgar, Timurhan, 
Almasta and Termez. Atheist policies, anti-religion conferences, publications etc. were 
encouraged. In oppressing Muslims subjected to extreme poverty, Stalin was 
delighted.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Banned Muslim pilgrimage centers, destroyed economic systems like waqf, led 
anti-religious and anti-Islamic false propaganda, made several attempts to specifically 
target the Muslim population, banned Arabic language, colonized Cyrillic language on 
Muslims, this is how the anti-Muslim communist plans go. Since February 23, 1994, an 
estimated 350,000-400,000 Chechens and 91,250 Ingush have been deported, ignoring 
the winter. On May 17, 2000 Muslim Tatars from Crimea were deported from their 
homelands in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to other parts of Soviet Russia. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">  After the 1980s, the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 due to the finance crisis. The 
collapse of Communism gave breathing space to Muslims who had suffered 74 years 
of oppression. The Muslim population, which had declined due to migration, conflicts 
and other reasons, began to increase after the 1990s. Cut off from their religion for a 
century, Russians resumed their Christian identity or converted to Islam. In this new 
era, Muslims began to become more organized and proselytize more actively within 
Russia. In the 18th century, all muftiats established under Tsarist Russia were 
combined to form the Government Directorate of Religious Affairs. Currently, the 
number of Muslims in Russia is about 30 million.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Meanwhile, following the demise of the Soviet Union, the number of mosques 
within the federation rose from 500 to 5,000.
