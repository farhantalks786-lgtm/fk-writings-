      In this Essay, I will share my thoughts about “youth creating a peaceful future”. This 
topic is relevant these days, because now youngsters have become bad. The discussion 
about this topic is very essential for this period. 
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Youth is the spirit of society. If the youth become bad, society becomes bad. Youth is 
the time of blood boiling. In this period, Youngsters can do anything they want. If youth 
become bad, a bad society will be born. That is a very huge threat for this society. On the 
contrary, If these youngsters become proficient and efficients, this world will become better. 
Children must be smooth tempered. Youngsters must try to obtain accomplishment and 
victory. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">  Youngsters are leaders of the society. Youth can conduct anything. Youngsters have a 
conclusive role for the society set up. If youngsters are trapped in monetary -wishes, they 
cannot make a model-society. The youngsters do not trap with these evil practices. So, 
youngsters have to be proactive about these things. Youth is the better period of a person in 
all things like health and decision making. During childhood, one's parents may make 
decisions for him and in older days his family may make decisions for him. On the contrary, 
at a young age, he can make any decision himself.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">According to the Islamic belief, On the day of judgment, The men will be close to the 
sun. Then the Almighty will give some people his special shade as a reward. Among them, 
one person who grew up in good habits and good behavior. Youth has to face many 
problems. They should keep their distance from evil deeds. In the second phase, Youth is 
the better period to do good deeds like social work. According to these good deeds, they can 
participate in building a creative future. Youngsters had to earn in this period – the things 
they had to have in the future. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">  The youngsters of this time are the leaders of the coming society. So, they should be 
patient and peaceful. In youth, there are some chances to walk into bad deeds like terrorism 
and robberies. Youngsters should pay attention to these bad deeds. Youngsters must learn 
good habits. Though in this world a good society will be born. Now! The youngsters are like 
sacrificial lambs of drugs. Disruption from these bad deeds is essential for youngsters. The 
youngsters should be proactive and vigilant about these things.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Youngsters have magnificent faculty in building up the society. Youngsters have to 
fence their body and their mind from evil practices, If not they are distinct calamities to 
humankind. Youngsters are agents of change in society and building sustainable 
communities. Dawit Mamet said that “old age and treachery will always beat youth and 
exacerbate”. Youth is the hope of the future. “Youth is wasted on the ground” – said Georg 
Bernard Shaw. Sani Slav Lee said that “youth is a gift of nature, but age is a work of art”. All 
youngsters must do good deeds and must bring peace in the future. I wish to all to make a 
peaceful future.  
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">In a nutshell, If the youth society will be bad that society will completely be bad. 
Youngsters are leaders of the society. Youngsters must have to keep disruption from bad 
deeds like monetary-wishes. Youth is the best period to do good deeds like social work. The 
youngsters of this time are the leaders of the coming society. So, they should be patient and 
peaceful. Youngsters have magnificent faculty in building up the society. Youngsters have to 
fence their body and their mind from evil practices.</p>
