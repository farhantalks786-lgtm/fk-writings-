    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Since the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan in August 2021, the legal landscape 
has shifted dramatically. The group's rule has brought significant changes to the country’s 
legal system, moving it away from the modernized and internationally influenced framework 
that had developed under previous governments. The Taliban's new code of law is grounded 
in a strict interpretation of Islamic law (Sharia), affecting various aspects of Afghan society, 
including the rights of women and girls, freedom of expression, and justice procedures. This 
essay explores the nature of these changes, the impact on Afghan citizens, and the broader 
implications for international human rights. </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">The Taliban’s legal framework in Afghanistan is centered on their interpretation of Sharia. 
Their code of law emphasizes adherence to conservative Islamic principles as interpreted by 
their scholars. Under this system, there is limited separation between religion and law, which 
means that the judiciary and government officials are primarily responsible for enforcing 
Islamic principles. The Taliban assert that their approach provides moral order and 
discourages crimes by instilling religious fear, but it has drawn criticism for being harsh and 
restrictive, especially toward certain groups. </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">One of the most controversial and widely condemned changes under the Taliban's new 
laws concerns the treatment of women and girls. The Taliban have imposed significant 
restrictions on female education, barring girls from attending secondary schools and 
universities. Women are largely excluded from workplaces, and the new legal code dictates 
strict dress codes and mobility restrictions, requiring women to be accompanied by a male 
relative in public. Women who were once active in politics, education, and healthcare face 
severe limitations, and many fear punishment for challenging these laws.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">The Taliban's interpretation of Sharia involves a strict approach to justice and 
punishment, often characterized by corporal punishments. Reports indicate that 
punishments such as amputation for theft, public floggings for adultery, and even executions 
for certain crimes are being reintroduced. These practices are part of a broader approach to 
justice that the Taliban justify as deterrence against crime. However, international human 
rights organizations have condemned these punishments as severe and inhumane, arguing 
that they violate basic human rights standards and fail to allow for fair trials and due process.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Under Taliban rule, freedom of expression has been heavily curtailed. The media 
landscape has changed drastically, with independent news agencies shutting down or being 
forced to operate under strict censorship. Journalists face significant risks, and many have 
been detained, threatened, or even killed. Public dissent and protests, especially those led 
by women, are often met with forceful suppression. This crackdown on expression reflects 
the Taliban's desire to maintain control over public narratives and to limit any opposition to 
their rule.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">The Taliban’s new legal code has faced widespread international criticism. Human rights 
organizations, including the United Nations, have expressed concern over the deteriorating 
situation in Afghanistan, particularly regarding the treatment of women and minorities. The 
international community, while cautious about engaging with the Taliban, has attempted to 
apply pressure by withholding formal recognition and limiting financial support. Humanitarian 
aid continues, but restrictions on foreign investment and development funds have 
contributed to Afghanistan’s worsening economic situation. The Taliban, however, remain 
resistant to external influence, insisting that their legal system is in line with Afghan cultural 
values and Islamic principles.</p>
