    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Islam is one of the dominant religions in the world and has significantly influenced the 
political and social situation in most countries either directly or indirectly. This religion has 
been considered as started in the early 7th century CE after other major religions; Judaism 
and Christianity. 
         
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">During the sixth and the seventh centuries. The Arabs were polytheists, who worship 
more than one god. They are widely known as heathens. When we talk about Islam, we 
cannot avoid talking about the prophet. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">He was 40 years of age when he proclaimed that the true god had revealed to him a 
doctrine of divine reward of obedience and consequences of falling to heed his teachings. 
The Islamic theories had profoundly influenced the political situations. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The moderate Islamic view stresses the concepts of maslaha (public interest), ‘Adl’ 
(justice), and Shura. Islamic leaders are considered to uphold justice if they promote public 
interest, as defined through shura.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Islam has influenced the world greatly. Islam’s golden age in science, technology and 
intellectual culture spanned about 500 years, from the ninths until the 14th centuries. 
Muslims achievements in these areas greatly influenced the European renaissance of the 
15th and 16th centuries, as well as the birth of modern scientific method in the 17th century. 
The political leader of Muslims is called caliph. Caliph was first used in the 7th century AD, 
for Abu Bakr, who was elected head of the Muslim community after the Prophet 
Muhammad’s death. In Islam there is no monarchy or aristocracy under the caliph. Islam’s 
justices were wonderful. If anyone stole anything for the food, the one who did this sin is the 
caliph, because the caliph has to be aware of his people.  </p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Some are saying that the Islam spreads political vendetta and religious intolerance and uses 
swords to make all people Muslims. Islam is doctrine, obedience, heading, renaissance and 
intellect Islam is broadly divided into two sections according to the belief Sunni and Shia.
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Islam, with over 1.8 billion followers, is a religion that deeply shapes the political and 
social landscapes of societies worldwide. Its core tenets provide a moral compass, legal 
framework, and framework for social interaction for Muslims. This essay explores the 
multifaceted influence of Islam on political and social structures, acknowledging both its 
unifying and divisive potential.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Islam offers a holistic worldview, encompassing both religious and worldly matters. The 
Quran and the teachings of Prophet Muhammad provide guidance on leadership, justice, 
and social order. This has led to the concept of an Islamic state, where Islamic law (Sharia) 
informs governance. However, interpretations of Sharia and the role of religion in 
government vary widely.Islam provides a comprehensive framework for daily life, 
encompassing personal conduct, family structures, and social interactions. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Islamic law governs various aspects of life, from contracts to criminal justice. It promotes 
ethical conduct and discourages social ills.The Quran prescribes roles and responsibilities 
within families, emphasizing respect and compassion.  </p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Islam's influence on political and social structures is undeniable. It can be a powerful 
force for social justice, community, and ethical conduct. However, navigating its diverse 
interpretations and addressing contemporary challenges is crucial for building peaceful and 
inclusive societies. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Islam offers a wealth of positive aspects that influence the lives of its followers and society 
as a whole.Islam promotes a clear belief system centered on one God (Allah), fostering a 
sense of purpose and responsibility. Islamic teachings emphasize treating others justly, 
regardless of background. This promotes social harmony and discourages oppression. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Zakat, a mandatory act of charity, encourages helping those less fortunate and fosters 
social responsibility.Islam promotes modesty, honesty, and self-control, contributing to a 
more ethical society.It fosters a strong sense of belonging to a global Muslim community 
(Ummah), offering support and connection.It emphasizes respect and care for family 
members, promoting strong social bonds.Islamic principles encourage volunteering and 
helping others, strengthening social networks.It promotes peace as a desirable state and 
discourages violence except in self-defense. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Islam teaches acceptance of God's will, providing comfort and strength in difficult 
times.Islamic teachings encourage striving to be a better person, both morally and 
spiritually.Regular prayer fosters inner peace, gratitude, and a connection with something 
larger than oneself.Belief in an afterlife provides comfort and motivates Muslims to live a 
meaningful life. Historically, Islamic societies made significant contributions to science, 
medicine, and mathematics. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Islam is an Arabic word meaning submission and therefore Islam religion is believed to be 
an Abrahamic religion which believes in submission to the almighty God Allah and 
Muhammad as the prophet. Quran is the holy book believed to be the guideline of the 
Muslims who are the followers of the Islamic religion. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Islam, now one of the major religions of the world, was found by a prophet, named 
Muhammad. The idea of Islam is that the believer, called a Muslim, accepts surrender to the 
will of Allah, who is their God. Allah is viewed as the creator of the world. Islam is much like 
Christianity, as they are both monotheistic, potentially believing in the same God. Islam’s 
practices are written in the holy book, called the Qur’an, or Koran in English. Allah revealed 
the Koran to his messenger, Muhammad, who is considered the last of a series of prophets 
(Rahmin). Within the Islam religion, Muslims practice the Five Pillars of Islam, which is one 
of the most important practices. The Five Pillars of Islam are the five obligations that every 
muslim must satisfy in order to live a good and responsible life according to Islam (Five 
Pillars of Islam). Carrying out the Five Pillars demonstrates the Muslim is putting their faith 
first. The first pillar is called “Shahadah,” which focuses on reciting the Muslim profession of 
faith.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Another unique feature of Islam is that it establishes a balance between individualism and 
collectivism. It believes in the individual personality of man and holds everyone personally 
accountable to Allah. It guarantees the fundamental rights of the individual and does not 
permit anyone to tamper with them.     </p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Islam's influence on political and social structures is undeniable. The "basic aim" of 
Islamic morality and ethics is "to achieve" Raza-e Ilahi (the Pleasure of God)" or to make 
God's pleasure "the objective of man's life".</p>
